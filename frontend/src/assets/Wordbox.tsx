Each keystroke is a step toward clarity, a bridge from inspiration to expression. To type well is to communicate effortlessly, to let words flow as naturally as they come to mind. It's not about speed or style; it’s about connecting with the person on the other end and bringing ideas to life with precision. Master the keyboard, and you hold the power to shape, share, and inspire. Remember, tools are just tools – it’s what you do with them that counts."
